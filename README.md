Todo Application using JavaScript
Description:

I have developed a Todo application using JavaScript to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end web development. This application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

Task Management:

Users can add new tasks with a title and description.
Tasks can be marked as completed or pending.
Dynamic Updates:

Real-time updates without page reload using JavaScript.
Tasks are dynamically added, updated, or removed from the interface.
Responsive Design:

The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
LocalStorage Integration:

Tasks are stored locally, allowing users to close and reopen the application without losing their data.
Technologies Used:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Storage: LocalStorage for data persistence
